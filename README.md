Follow these steps to assemble the PCB and mounting bracket:

	1.  Solder the spade connectors to the PCB.  Ensure they are inserted onto the backside of the PCB, the side that has no white text.
	2.  Solder the Speak-On connectors to the PCB.  Ensure they are inserted onto the front of the PCB, the side that has text.
	3.  Mount Speak-On connectors onto mounting plate and screw screws into lock nuts on backside.

The following steps are optional for additional.  They make the connections stronger, further preventing damage to connectors when Speak-On cables plugged/unplugged.

	1.  For the holes on the mounting plate that have no Speak-On connector holes on them, drill holes using the drill bit.
	2.  Insert additional screws and tighten them using lock nuts.
